## üü° STATUS: DEVELOPMENT PAUSED - ROUTING IMPLEMENTATION BLOCKED

### üéØ Objective

The goal of the current phase was to implement a new feature: allowing users to enter a start and destination, calculating the route via the Google Maps API, and displaying that route as a line on the existing Mapbox map.

### üõ†Ô∏è Work Completed

- **Test-Driven Development:** Created a Playwright E2E test (`e2e/google-route-display.spec.ts`) to define the desired user flow.
- **Frontend Scaffolding:** Built a new, public-facing SvelteKit page at `/trip` containing:
  -  `+page.svelte`: A component with input fields for start/destination, a submission button, and a Mapbox map instance.
  -  `+page.server.ts`: A SvelteKit Form Action to handle the form submission.
- **Backend Logic:** The server-side action successfully:
  -  Receives the start and destination addresses.
  -  Uses the existing Mapbox Geocoding API proxy to convert addresses to coordinates.
  -  Sends the coordinates to the existing Google Maps Routing API proxy to fetch the route polyline.
- **Reactive UI:** The frontend component was wired to be reactive, listening for the new route data and designed to automatically draw it on the map using a GeoJSON layer.

### üõë BLOCKING ISSUE

Despite a thorough, by-the-book implementation following official SvelteKit documentation, the Playwright test consistently fails with a `Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded` error. 

The root cause is that the test is unable to find the `input[placeholder="Start"]` field on the `/trip` page. This indicates that **the SvelteKit router is not rendering the page component we created**, and is likely displaying a different page (e.g., a 404 page or a redirect). 

### üîç Troubleshooting Performed

- **Isolating Authentication:** Moved the page from the protected `(app)` group to a public route to rule out login/session issues.
- **Layout Hierarchy:** Created a blank `+layout.svelte` for the `/trip` route to explicitly break any inheritance from global layouts that might be causing redirects.
- **Server State:** Restarted the Vite development server multiple times to clear any potential caching issues.
- **Documentation Review:** Consulted the latest SvelteKit documentation via `context7` to confirm the file-based routing, form actions, and page-loading logic were all implemented according to current best practices.

### ÁµêË´ñ (Conclusion)

The repeated failure, despite code that aligns with official documentation, strongly suggests the issue lies in a **project-level configuration** that is overriding the expected routing behavior. The problem is not in the feature code itself, but in the environment in which it is trying to run.

Possible sources of this conflict include:
- A custom server hook (`src/hooks.server.ts`).
- A complex global layout (`src/routes/+layout.svelte`).
- A non-standard `vite.config.ts` configuration.

**Development on this feature is paused until this underlying routing conflict is identified and resolved.** The created files provide a solid, standards-compliant foundation to be activated once the blockage is cleared.
