# Project Status: PHASE 4 BLOCKED

**Current Branch:** `Phase4-Test-Gemini`

## ðŸ›‘ STATUS: BLOCKED

The project is currently blocked due to a persistent and critical runtime error.

**Issue:** A `500 Internal Server Error` occurs immediately when the SvelteKit development server attempts to render the main page. This prevents the application from loading and all Playwright tests from running.

**GitHub Issue:** For a detailed technical breakdown of the problem and the extensive debugging steps already taken, please see **[Issue #1: [Blocked] Persistent 500 Internal Server Error on Startup](https://github.com/inphiltrator/roadtripper/issues/1)**.

### Summary of the Problem

Despite confirming that the database schema is correct and that the user data can be seeded successfully, the SvelteKit server fails at runtime when trying to access the database via Prisma Client. This points to a deep, environment-specific conflict between SvelteKit's server-side rendering (SSR), Vite, and Prisma.

### Next Steps

- **Manual Debugging Required:** A developer needs to perform a hands-on debugging session on the local machine.
- **Isolate the Environment:** Create a minimal, reproducible example to test the SvelteKit + Prisma integration outside of this project's complexity.

All recent code changes, including attempts to fix this issue, have been committed and pushed to the `Phase4-Test-Gemini` branch.
